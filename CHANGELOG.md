# ChangeLog

NOTE: Version needs to be updated in the following places:
- [ ] Xcode project version (normal target)
- [ ] Xcode project version (watch target)
- [ ] Package.swift iOSApplication product displayVersion.
- [ ] ParticleBehavior.version (in Particle.swift) constant (must be hard coded since inaccessible in code)
- [ ] Tag with matching version in GitHub.

Optimized so that entire view isn't included with particles and just values to keep things light.
Add paged tabbed view for configuration and various demos like SimpleDemoView and include a demo for moving particles along a Shape path.

v1.0.3 5/13/2024 Added SimpleDemoView.  Reanmed Scheme in Xcode project.  Extracted ParticleEffects.swift to make it easier to find for version updates.  Re-worked Package.swift to be cleaner and support `swift package dump-package` for swiftpackageindex.com and enhanced for code re-use.

v1.0.2 5/7/2024  Fixed spacing in ChangeLog.  Updated icon to prevent confusion with KuditFrameworks.  Renamed from MotionEffects to ParticleEffects.

v1.0.1 5/4/2024 Changed version to MotionEffects.version for clarity/simplicity.  Added convenience initializer for ParticleSystemView.

v1.0.0 5/3/2024 Initial code and features.
